#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD candidate at the University of Glasgow. My research interests include multi-modal generation, natural language processing, and computer vision, with a primary focus on Generative Multi-modal Biomedical Natural Language Modeling. I am passionate about leveraging AI to drive innovations in biomedicine and improve healthcare outcomes.

I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from the Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in 2018, complemented by exchange programs at Stanford University and Ritsumeikan University. I achieved a dual Master’s degree from the University of Sydney (USYD) in 2022, including Information Technology (Data Management and Analytics) and IT Management.
